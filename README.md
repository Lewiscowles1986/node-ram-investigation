# NodeJS memory Usage

As a member of the NodeJS Slack group, I see a lot of messages. Someone in the group was complaining that their app slowed down or took too much RAM going from NodeJS 14 to NodeJS 20. They linked the following GitHub issue [NodeJS Issue 4228](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/4228).

Personally, I think it's wrong to expect someone to explain to you why your custom code is slower, or takes up a trivially small amount more RAM (10's of MB, not 100's), especially when going 6 major versions into the future; but I am also a curious creature.
